# .emacs.d
My personal Emacs init file

It is very unorganised right now.  I decided to put it here so I could work with it more conveniently.

*UPDATE*
Have organised it! but can always be improved, so original message stands.
That looks like a contradiction to me ^_^

--------------------------------
add this line to ~/.emacs to use:

(load-file "~/.emacs.d/init.el")
