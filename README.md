# .emacs.d
My personal Emacs init file

It is very unorganised right now.  I decided to put it here so I could work with it more conveniently.

*UPDATE*
Have organised it! but can always be improved, so original message stands.
That looks like a contradiction to me ^_^

--------------------------------
add this line to ~/.emacs to use:

(load-file "~/.emacs.d/init.el")

*UPDATE*
I switched to vim, because 25.1 release broke windows connectivity to the repositories.
There were ridiculous workarounds involving security protocols, and nobody was in a hurry to fix emacs itself.

I lost a lot of productivity from all the specialised configs and functions I had, so I decided to learn vanilla vim,
then add small stuff to it.  By the time they actually fixed it, I didn't care.

Now I can hardly use emacs, but I think more outside of the box with text editing, so that's fine.
